## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, though in the early stages there will be much work to be done before this really takes any understandable shape. The following are just some initial guidelines to keep this project clean and easy to navigate. More updates will be made to this README or another appropriate place as the project matures.

To contribute, you should:
1. Fork the repository
1. Create a working branch within your fork (see naming conventions below)
1. Complete any development, testing, and documentation.
1. Cleanup and sign your commit (see more below).
1. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main repo for review.

### Branch Naming

When contributing please use one of the following prefixes that best suits your changes followed by a brief description of your change: `bugfix`, `docs`, `feature`, `test`. Ex. `bugfix-fix-authentication` or `feature-split-transactions`.

### Code Signing

Before opening a PR, please rebase on the main project squashing all your commits into one commit and make sure to sign that commit. This project requires verified signatures to get approval for merging into main.
